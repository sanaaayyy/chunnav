## Chunav: Predictive Modeling for Election Outcomes

**Tagline:** "वोट हमारा है अनमोल। कभी न लगे इसका मोल।।" 
---

### Overview

Our project aims to address the inaccuracies and biases of conventional election outcome prediction methods, which rely on historical polling data and expert opinions, by developing a machine-learning model that enhances accuracy and reduces human error. Utilizing advanced data analysis techniques, our user-friendly model will integrate seamlessly into political strategies and decision-making processes. The innovative combination of Random Forest Regressor and Linear Regression Model for exit polling and K-means clustering to identify voter behaviour patterns allows for precise and customized predictions, promoting a more informed and engaged citizenry. This project has real-time applications in assisting political analysts, ensuring unbiased information flow, helping political parties strategize effectively, providing accurate poll estimates, and analyzing long-term polling trends to inform future policies and plans.

### Introduction

At VIT Bhopal, we are trained to develop critical thinking skills to analyze and solve complex problems around us. Leveraging software frameworks and logical thinking, our project aims to address inaccuracies and biases in election reporting. We combine simple mathematics, statistics, and domain knowledge to forecast election outcomes based on opinion and exit polls accurately.

### Existing Works and Research

Our project builds on various sentiment analysis studies of social media data to understand public perception and predict election outcomes. Notable research includes:
- "Sentiment analysis of social media data for understanding public perception of political parties in Indian elections" by S. S. Pandey et al. (2018)
- "Indian Elections 2014: Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Chatter" by K. Nagpal et al. (2015)
- "Mining Twitter Data for Predicting the 2014 Indian General Election Results" by A. Goyal et al. (2015)
- "Sentiment Analysis of Indian General Elections 2019 on Twitter" by R. Chakraborty and N. Chakraborty (2020)

### Problem Statement

Conventional methods of predicting election results, such as historical polling data and expert opinions, often prove inaccurate and biased. Our project aims to tackle these problems by developing a machine-learning model that predicts election outcomes more accurately, thereby minimizing human error and reducing data bias.

### Proposed Work and Methodology

We plan to develop a machine learning model utilizing advanced data analysis techniques to forecast election outcomes. This model will be designed to be user-friendly and easily accessible, facilitating seamless integration into political strategies and decision-making processes. By harnessing data-driven insights, we strive to enhance the democratic process.

### Novelty of the Project

Our innovative approach merges the Random Forest Regressor with the Linear Regression Model for exit polling, yielding a more comprehensive and accurate analysis of voter preferences. By applying K-means clustering, we can uncover patterns in voter behaviour, leading to highly precise and customized models for predicting election outcomes. This novel methodology improves our understanding of the electorate and supports a more informed and engaged citizenry.

### Real-Time Usage

Our project offers several practical applications:
- Assisting political analysts in accurately predicting electoral patterns
- Ensuring the unbiased dissemination of information regarding polling patterns
- Aiding political parties in formulating effective strategies for forthcoming elections
- Providing precise estimates of poll results
- Examining long-term shifts in polling patterns to guide future policy and planning decisions

### Hardware and Software Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab
- Python Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit, matplotlib, scipy, plotly
- Design tools: Figma
- Curated datasets of election results and social media trends


### Datasets Used

- Lok Sabha Winners 2019 data
- Indian 2019 Lok Sabha Election Exit Poll Data Set
